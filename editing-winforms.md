# Editing WinForms

After [opening your WinForm from  VS Code](https://github.com/ironmansoftware/csharp-winform-designer/blob/master/opening-a-winform.md), the C# WinForm Designer will open. You can click controls on the right hand side and then click on the form to add them to the form.

Selecting a control on the form will change the property grid to that control's properties. Editing the properties will update the form designer code after saving the form.

## Event Handlers

You can add event handlers by either double clicking on the control to add the default event handler for the control, or by clicking the event tab in the property grid to add the event handler of your choice.
